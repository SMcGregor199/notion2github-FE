    "There’s something I’ve noticed about some programmers who’ve been in the game for a while: a subtle way of talking that carries an air of superiority. It’s not always intentional. Sometimes it’s in a chuckle at someone’s “beginner” mistake, or in the way a senior dev describes a framework as if only a fool would use it. What’s odd is that every one of them was once a beginner too—someone who Googled everything, who didn’t yet know the syntax, who quietly hoped Stack Overflow would be kind.",
    "I think what we’re seeing is something psychologists call the expert blind spot—that strange amnesia that happens when you get so fluent in something that you forget what it was like not to be. In software, it’s everywhere. Code that once took days to understand now looks “obvious.” Bugs that once felt impossible now seem trivial. So when a newer developer asks a question, the expert’s empathy short-circuits. They don’t remember the uncertainty, only their current clarity.",
    "But there’s also a cultural layer to it. Tech loves to believe in meritocracy—the idea that brilliance naturally rises to the top. It sounds noble, but it often leads to subtle hierarchies. If your worth is tied to being the smartest in the room, then you protect that image. You correct, you scoff, you signal mastery. And somewhere along the way, the joy of learning—and helping others learn—gets lost.",
    "The irony, of course, is that the best engineers I’ve met aren’t like that at all. They’re grounded. They remember how fast the field moves, how fragile expertise really is. They know that humility and curiosity are what keep you employable—and human.",
    "Maybe the next phase of software maturity isn’t about cleaner abstractions or faster compilers. Maybe it’s about empathy. About remembering that good code is collaborative, and the most generous thing a senior engineer can do is teach like they still remember how it felt to ask."
